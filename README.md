Automatic Discrimination between Printed and Handwritten Text in Documents
This repository contains the implementation of the research paper "Automatic discrimination between printed and handwritten text in documents" by Lincoln Faria da Silva, Aura Conci, and Angel Sanchez. The project focuses on distinguishing between printed and handwritten text in scanned documents using a series of steps including digitalization, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
We have implemented the feature extraction after applying various Digital Image Processing Techniques such Morphological Operations, Gaussian Smoothing, otsu thresholding, etc.
Introduction
The recognition techniques for printed and handwritten text in scanned documents vary significantly. This project aims to automatically identify and distinguish between these two types of text. The approach includes removal of black lines from the form, which is filled with handwritten text.

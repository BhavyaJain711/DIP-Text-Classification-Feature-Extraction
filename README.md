# Automatic Discrimination between Printed and Handwritten Text in Documents

This repository contains the implementation of the research paper "Automatic discrimination between printed and handwritten text in documents" by Lincoln Faria da Silva, Aura Conci, and Angel Sanchez. The project focuses on distinguishing between printed and handwritten text in scanned documents using a series of steps including digitalization, preprocessing, and feature extraction.

## Introduction

The recognition techniques for printed and handwritten text in scanned documents vary significantly. This project aims to automatically identify and distinguish between these two types of text. The approach includes the removal of black lines from the form, which is filled with handwritten text. We have implemented feature extraction after applying various Digital Image Processing Techniques such as Morphological Operations, Gaussian Smoothing, and Otsu Thresholding.

## Features

- Digitalization of documents.
- Preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare document images.
- Feature extraction from words in the document.
